Status
======

This library is production ready.

Description
===========

This library provides a client interface for the [Duo Mobile Auth API](https://duo.com/docs/authapi), providing strong two-factor authentication for websites or applications.

Synopsis
========

```lua
local cjson = require "cjson.safe"
local duo = require "resty.duo"


-- create a new integration object based on the application data created
-- by Duo's admin interface
local d = duo.new({
  ikey = "integation key",
  skey = "secret key",
  host = "api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com",
})


-- the 'duo_request' method can be used to call various Duo Auth API endpoints
-- see https://duo.com/docs/authapi#/check
local res, err = d:duo_request('check')

if not res then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Could not contact Duo API server")
end

if res.status ~= 200 then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Duo API server returned invalid status code")
end

local body = cjson.decode(res.body)
if not body then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Could not decode Duo API server response")
end

if body.stat ~= "OK" then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Duo API server returned invalid API response")
end


-- several methods are provided to wrap API response and error checking
-- for example, enroll a new user with the application
-- see https://duo.com/docs/authapi#/enroll
local res, msg = d:enroll(username)
if not res then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, msg)
end


-- authenticate a user (having been previously authenticated by your application)
-- note the second param can be used to provide the IP address to Duo to identify
-- requests coming from a trusted remote address
-- if the request is successful, the 'preauth' object will be in the form noted at
-- https://duo.com/docs/authapi#/preauth
local preauth, err = d:preauth(username, ngx.var.remote_addr
if err then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, msg)
end


-- from here, examine the 'preauth.result' value and act accordingly. refer to the API
-- documentation for details. in the case of an 'auth' result, request should be
-- authenticated with Duo
-- see https://duo.com/docs/authapi#/auth
local auth, err = d:auth(username, factor, duo_params)
if err then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, msg)
end
if auth.result == "deny" then
  ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED)
end
```


Usage
=====

duo.new
-------

**syntax**: *duo_object = duo.new(opts)*

Create a new `duo` object based on the Duo Application configuration options:

* **opts.ikey**: The application integration key.
* **opts.skey**: The application secret key.
* **opts.host**: The application hostname.

duo:enroll
----------

**syntax**: *res, err = duo:enroll(username)*

Enroll a new user with the Duo application. On sucess, `err` will be nil and `res` will be a table returned from the `/enroll` Duo Auth API endpoint. If there is a failure in the HTTP transaction or an API err, `res` will be nil and `err` will be a string describing the failure. The string may be JSON-encoded data if an error is returned from the Duo Auth API.

duo:preauth
-----------

**syntax**: *preauth, err = duo:preauth(username, ipaddr?)*

Pre-authenticate a user with the Duo Auth API. This method determines whether a user is authorized to log in, and (if so) returns the user's available authentication factors. On sucess, `err` will be nil and `res` will be a table returned from the `/preauth` Duo Auth API endpoint. If there is a failure in the HTTP transaction or an API err, `res` will be nil and `err` will be a string describing the failure. The string may be JSON-encoded data if an error is returned from the Duo Auth API.

The `ipaddr` param may be provided as the IP address of the client in dotted-quad notation. This will cause an "allow" response to be sent if appropriate for requests from a trusted network.

duo:auth
--------

**syntax**: *auth, err = duo:auth(username, factor, duo_params)*

Authenticate a user with the Duo Auth API. This method performs second-factor authentication for a user by sending a push notification to the user's smartphone app, verifying a passcode, or placing a phone call. It is also used to send the user a new batch of passcodes via SMS. On sucess, `err` will be nil and `res` will be a table returned from the `/auth` Duo Auth API endpoint. If there is a failure in the HTTP transaction or an API err, `res` will be nil and `err` will be a string describing the failure. The string may be JSON-encoded data if an error is returned from the Duo Auth API.

The appropriate `factor` and `duo_params` method parameters should be defined based on the response from the `preauth` call. `factor` should be a string value such as `push` or `sms`, and `duo_params` should be formatted as a table of factor-specific parameters to pass to Duo Auth. See [Duo Auth API documentation](https://duo.com/docs/authapi#/auth) for specific details.

duo:duo_request
---------------

**syntax**: *res, err = duo:duo_request(endpoint, api_params)*

Low-level call to generate a Duo Auth API request based on the API endpoint and appropriate parameters. This method will sign the HTTP request with the `duo` object's `ikey`/`skey` values, and return the request of a `lua-resty-http:request_uri` call.

duo.sign
--------

**syntax**: *date, sig = duo.sign(method, host, path, params, ikey, skey)*

Static function to sign an HTTP request as defined in the [Duo Auth API documentation](https://duo.com/docs/authapi#authentication). In general this function does not need to be called as part of a typicaly request flow.

TODO
====

* Add wrapper methods around remaining Duo Auth API endpoints (`/enroll_status`, `auth_status`, etc).
* Clean up error handling a bit in `read_duo_response`.
* Validate `duo` object on creation.
* Implement native support for async auth requests.
